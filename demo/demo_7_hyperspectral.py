"""Demo 7: hyperspectral reconstruction.

A hyperspectral scan measures the transmission of every detector pixel in
many wavelength bins.  A sample of a few materials has a low-rank
attenuation: a map per material times a spectrum per material.  The scan is
dehydrated to those few maps, each map is reconstructed on its own, and the
reconstructions are rehydrated to a volume at every wavelength.  This is far
cheaper than reconstructing every wavelength bin, and the noise of the bins
is averaged away.
